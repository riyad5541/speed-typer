    <h1>1.Difference between local storage and session storage?</h1>
    <p>The read-only sessionStorage property accesses a session Storage object for the current origin. sessionStorage is similar to localStorage; the difference is that while data in localStorage doesn't expire, data in sessionStorage is cleared when the page session ends.</p>
    <br>
    <h1>2.Difference between global and block scope?</h1>
    <p>The variables defined outside of any function or curly brackets are known as global variables and have global scope. Global scope means that the variables can be accessed from any part of that program, any function or conditional state can access that variable.
        <br>
        Block scope is also a sub-type of local scope. The block scope can be defined as the scope of the variables inside the curly brackets {}. Now, these curly brackets can be of loops, or conditional statements, or something else. You are only allowed to refer to these variables from within the curly brackets {}.

    <h1>3.Explain javascript event loops? </h1>
    <p>The event loop is a process that waits for the Call Stack to be clear before pushing callbacks from the Task Queue to the Call Stack. Once the Stack is clear, the event loop triggers and checks the Task Queue for available callbacks. If there are any, it pushes it to the Call Stack, waits for the Call Stack to be clear again, and repeats the same process.

    <h1>4.How many way to get undefine in javascript?</h1>
    <p>undefined is a property of the global object. That is, it is a variable in global scope. The initial
        value of undefined is the primitive value undefined.

        In all non-legacy browsers, undefined is a non-configurable, non-writable property. (Even when this
        is not the case, avoid overriding it.)

        A variable that has not been assigned a value is of type undefined. A method or statement also
        returns undefined if the variable that is being evaluated does not have an assigned value. A
        function returns undefined if a value was not returned.<br><br>
